# Remote sensing and ML
 This project explores the application of Sentinel-2 data for flood damage assessment, combined with change detection techniques and machine learning.
 
 ## Overview
 The frequency and severity of natural disasters threatens human health as well as infrastructures and environment, making it crucial to find instruments able to give rapid and accurate damage assessment reports. In the last years, remote sensing technology proved its efficiency and comprehensiveness in disaster monitoring. \
 During this report Sentinel-2's 13 spectral bands are exploited so that, by combining them in various ways, it is possible to enhance the detection of specific features and changes in the landscape, making multi-spectral analysis a powerful tool for flood mapping. \
 In addition to this, change detection techniques are explored, in order to study and monitor land coverage before and after flood. Machine learning algorithms are employed too, particularly unsupervised methods like clustering, that can automate the analysis of satellites data, making the identification of flood-affected areas and the classification of land cover changes more efficient.
 
 ## Methodology
 - Pre-processing of Sentinel-2 data
 - Computation of NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index)
 - Change detection techniques:
    - Histogram comparison
	- Ratio
	- Difference
	- Change vector analysis
- Machine Learning:
	- Unsupervised clustering techniques
	
## Conclusions
Through the exploitation of band combination, ratio and difference calculation between pre- and post-flood event, histogram comparison, change
vector analysis and unsupervised clustering algorithms, I
have achieved a detailed segmentation of the flooded areas.
